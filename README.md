This is my attempt at trying to recreate GalXon in WebXR, using react-three-fiber. At the same time, I'm experimenting to see if I can use as many approaches and frameworks that I regularly use in other 
React projects, like Redux and Storybook.

At the time of writing, I'm developing all of the components and scenarios 
in Storybook and there is no playable game yet. The Storybook pages can be 
found online here: https://galconxr.app.leunix.nl/storybook/
