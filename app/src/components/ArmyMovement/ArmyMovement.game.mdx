# Game/ArmyMovement

The responsibility of the ArmyMovement component is to generate a number of armies that move from planet A to planet B. As the armies get closer to Planet B, it will start dispatching `landArmy` actions to the store.

These stories focus on ensuring that the ArmyMovement component works well in conjunction with the Redux store.
